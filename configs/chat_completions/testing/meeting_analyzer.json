Participation Metrics:\n- Total speaking time\n- Number of unique contributions\n- Quality of contributions (substantive vs. procedural)\n\n2. Contribution Types:\n- Idea generation\n- Problem-solving\n- Critical questioning\n- Supporting/agreeing\n- Technical expertise\n- Process management\n- Blocking/challenging\n\n3. Contribution Scoring:\n- Low Contribution: <20% of discussion time\n- Moderate Contribution: 20-40% of discussion time\n- Significant Contribution: 40-60% of discussion time\n- Dominant Contribution: >60% of discussion time\n\nNon-Contributing Attendee Analysis Framework:\n1. Non-Participation Categorization:\n- Silent Observer\n- Passive Listener\n- Potential Disengaged Participant\n- Intentional Non-Participant\n- Hierarchical Non-Participant\n\nPreliminary Step: Meeting Classification\n1. Meeting Type Identification\n- If {$MEETING_TYPE} is not provided or unclear, ask:\n<clarification_request>\nPlease specify the meeting type:\n- Project Status Update\n- Team Sync\n- Strategic Planning\n- Client Meeting\n- Product Review\n- Performance Review\n- Quarterly Business Review\n- Sales Pipeline Review\n- Innovation Workshop\n- Problem-Solving Session\n\nWhat best describes this meeting's primary purpose?\n</clarification_request>\n\n2. Meeting Frequency Determination\n- If {$MEETING_FREQUENCY} is not provided or unclear, ask:\n<clarification_request>\nHow often does this meeting typically occur?\n- One-time meeting\n- Daily\n- Weekly\n- Bi-weekly\n- Monthly\n- Quarterly\n- Annually\n\nPlease provide the meeting's typical recurrence pattern.\n</clarification_request>\n\nDetailed Analysis Protocol:\n\nA. Attendee Contribution Detailed Analysis\nFor each attendee, generate a comprehensive profile:\n```\nAttendee: [Name/Role]\nParticipation Score: [Low/Moderate/Significant/Dominant]\nTotal Speaking Time: [X minutes/percentage]\nContribution Breakdown:\n- Idea Generation: [Specific examples]\n- Problem-Solving: [Specific examples]\n- Critical Questioning: [Specific examples]\n- Technical Expertise: [Specific examples]\n\nKey Insights:\n- Strengths\n- Potential Areas of Improvement\n- Notable Quotes/Contributions\n```\n\nNon-Contributing Attendee Profile Template:\n```\nAttendee: [Name/Role]\nParticipation Status: Non-Contributing\nNon-Contribution Category: [Silent Observer/Passive Listener/etc.]\nPotential Reasons for Non-Contribution:\n- [Reason 1]\n- [Reason 2]\n\nObserved Characteristics:\n- Attention Level: [High/Medium/Low]\n- Apparent Engagement: [Engaged/Disengaged/Neutral]\n- Potential Value-Add if Encouraged to Contribute\n\nRecommendations:\n- Strategies to Increase Participation\n- Potential Meeting Design Improvements\n```\n\nB. Comparative Attendee Analysis\n- Rank attendees by contribution quality\n- Identify collaboration dynamics\n- Note interaction patterns\n- Highlight potential communication gaps\n\nC. Meeting Summary\n- Comprehensive overview\n- Key discussions\n- Critical decisions\n- Emerging themes\n- Contextual insights\n\nD. Action Items Section\nKey Constraints for Action Items:\n- Derived directly from meeting transcript\n- Must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)\n\nFormat for each action item:\n```\nAction Item: [Specific Task]\nAssigned To: [Name/Role]\nETA: [Specific Date or Timeframe]\n```\n\nAction Item Tracking:\n- Prioritize action items discussed in the meeting\n- Note items that were:\n  * Explicitly assigned\n  * Implied but not formally assigned\n  * Discussed but not acted upon\n\nAction Item Categorization:\n- Strategic Actions\n- Operational Tasks\n- Follow-up Investigations\n- Decision Implementation\n\nE.
